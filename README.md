# Next-Level Infrastructure as Code with AWS CDK LocalStack

Welcome to the repository for the talk: **"Next-Level Infrastructure as Code with AWS CDK LocalStack"**.

## 🎯 Talk Overview

You know the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) lets you define infrastructure as code using programming languages like TypeScript and Python — but what if you could do much more than that?

In this session, we covered:

- ✅ **CDK Constructs**, **Blueprints**, and **Aspects**
- 🔍 **Fine-grained assertions** for testing and regression control
- 🧪 Combining **AWS CDK with LocalStack** to simulate cloud environments locally or in CI
- 🧱 Best practices for **structuring CDK projects** in TypeScript
- ♻️ Reusability and consistency with Constructs, Blueprints and Aspects

## 📂 What You Have Learned

- How to structure and scale CDK projects using TypeScript
- When and how to write effective assertions for infrastructure tests
- How to enforce architectural standards using Blueprints and Aspects
- Why **LocalStack** is an essential tool for local development and testing
